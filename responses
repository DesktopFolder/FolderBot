<!-- {ur} is the User being Responded to. {t.r} is the trident roll. {t.rolled} is the number of rolls, including the current one.

<!-- Trident PBs are only triggered once you have more than 5 rolls.
### TRIDENT_PB_GENERIC:
Wow, congratulations on your brand new trident PB of {t.r}, {ur}! Be sure to share this on social media, with your surely countless friends!
(checks notes) well, will you look at that, {t.r} is your best roll ever, {ur}. Fording a new frontier, surely.
Incredible!!! {ur}, great work on your {t.r}!

<!-- Other information that is provided to these strings: # of tridents rolled so far ({t.rolled})
### EARLY_HIGH_TRIDENT:
{t.r}. Wait, {t.r}? After only {t.rolled} trident rolls?! {ur}... you're hired.
{t.r} already... monkaS
Um. {t.r} shouldn't be possible in only {t.rolled} rolls. Are you using Zayd's datapack?

<!-- lol
### FIRST_TRIDENT_GENERIC:
{t.r}. Really off to a good start, hm, {ur}?
{t.r}!! For a first try, that's really good! Excited to see your next roll :)
Oooh, welcome to gambling, {ur}! You rolled a {t.r}... okay, don't get TOO excited! ;)
{t.r} :) Great work {ur}! You'll be rolling 250s just like Zayd soon enough!

### TRIDENT_DOUBLE_LOW:
Wow, another {t.r}. To commemorate this occasion, I have select a completely, 100%, naturally and statistically random quote: 'Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.' - Rita Mae Brown
Two {t.r}s in a row... are you using Coosh's datapack?
Annnnd it's {ur} with TWO {t.r} rolls! Great work, champ! Try for a third, will ya?
Wow, you're really frontloading these {t.r} trident rolls, eh {ur}? You know this won't affect your actual run luck, right?

### MISC_RARE_TRIDENTS:
{t.r}. Did you know? None of Folderbot's responses are sarcastic. They are all serious and meant in good faith :)
<!-- .-> follow-up likelihood? 'next response is' thing idk
{t.r}... pro tip: you should frontload HDWGH and get a trident after. That way, you can reset after failing it.
{t.r}. AA tip #5: Fly up while trying to get ocelots to spawn. The height will give you a sense of clarity, allowing you to reflect on the futility of your actions and the hopelessness of trying to get a good AA pb.
{t.r}. AA tip #9: In order to improve your game's performance, uninstall Minecraft. Next, get a job, and start working out. When you are elderly, return to the game - hardware will be much cheaper, and you will easily run 15 instances!
{t.r}. AA tip #3. Collect some rotten flesh to feed to dogs. Normally, that would kill them, but they are already in toxic shock syndrome due to the game running on java (coffee is very bad for dogs). Double toxicity will actually cure them.
{t.r}. AA tip #8. Do not do HDWGH near a ravine. Dolphins are thrill seekers and will happily abandon you for the adrenaline rush of base jumping.
{t.r}. AA tip #1. Don't craft all your haybales into wheat. This will enable you to easily breed llamas during any%, when you blind 50 blocks below the surface of a wooded mountain, again.
{t.r}. Sorry, I can't give a sassy response, I'm busy stealing code from Oskar.
{t.r}. Did you know? FolderBot is made with 95% recycled Oskar code! Our commitment to green software is only overshadowed by our commitment to sarcasm.
{t.r} deaths during debris split...
{t.r}. AA tip #41: Leave blocks behind you in your tunnel while doing debris. The thrill of breaking them on the way back, with TNT exploding right behind you, will increase your engagement with the run. wideDesktopfolderDebrisFail
{t.r}. Slimestone tip #18: Observer extension spam is the best way to solve problems in your flying machine. The more observers, the better!
{t.r}. AA tip #17: Many players waste pearls trying to get endermite, which has only a 1/10 chance of spawning. Instead, get an enderwill, which is 100%.
{t.r}. AA tip #26: Before doing HDWGH, ensure you teach your dolphin not to get in between you and your shulker boxes. This may require additional training, but can prevent... 'problematic' situations.
{t.r}. AA tip #39: Stop trying to get a sub 3, DesktopFolder. It's not happening. Inanimate objects cannot play Minecraft.
{t.r}. AA tip #18: Play on hard in the nether. This will help your runs end faster :)
{t.r}. FolderBot fact! Did you know that you can use !commands to get a list of helpful, fun commands to use?
{t.r}. FolderBot fact! Did you know that you can set your own nickname? Use !nick to change it!
{t.r}. FolderBot fact! Have you heard? You can check your own data with !getdata :)
{t.r}. Fun FolderBot fact! FolderBot is written in pure Rust code. Not so fun fact! The code is VERY, VERY bad.
{t.r}. Did you know? You can see all of FolderBot's code online. I'm not going to give you a link, though. That would make it too easy.
{t.r}. FolderBot fact: Every time another of these facts get added, it becomes less likely to roll any individual one! That means this response is rare, and you should give me money for it.
{t.r}. AA tip #44: Did you know? Iron golems deal damage! Try not to melee them with an elytra on, on Normal, during raid. But I mean - you're not THAT dumb. Right, {ur}?
{t.r}. FolderBot fact: None of FolderBot is documented. So, these folderbot facts are actually the best documentation there is! Want to know how to change your nickname? Better get rolling!
{t.r}. RollTrident fact: the_zayd was the first to roll a 250, on January 27, 2024, while DesktopFolder was in the middle of throwing yet another AA run.

### TRIDENT_VALUE_250:
{t.r}. You've finally done it, {ur}. You've - you've finally done it. I'm speechless.
It's... I can't say it. Should I say it? CAN I say it? ...you rolled a {t.r}, {ur}. You actually did it.
{t.r}. {t.r}. {t.r}. You're a legend, {ur}.
{t.r}. I can't believe my eyes. For your great accomplishment, {ur}, I shall bestow upon you this token: PagMan
You did it, {ur}! You rolled a perfect {t.r}! NOW STOP SPAMMING MY CHAT, YOU NO LIFE TWITCH ADDICT!
{ur}! You rolled a {t.r}!! Just kidding. No, I wasn't kidding, this was a reverse bait. This is actually a (very) rare 250 response. Trust me.
I hereby certify that {ur} has rolled a natural {t.r}. A moment of silence, please.

<!-- these are automatically included via TRIDENT_VALUE_RARE_{n} with 1/10 chance
### TRIDENT_VALUE_RARE_19:
You... didn't get a trident! Don't feel too bad, it's a 1/10.
{ur} kills a drowned, then goes to check the trident - but oh, it didn't drop.
{ur}... you don't have a trident yet. Stop trying to 'check its value'.

### TRIDENT_VALUE_RARE_6:
3! Yes, Oskar, this is actually a 6. It's a factorial. This is the only time it will ever be a factorial.
6. That's... that's ok? I guess. I mean, it's not great. Honestly, it's somewhat disappointing. But it's like, it's acceptable, I guess.
...6. YEP. I guess that's ok ... ish.

### TRIDENT_VALUE_RARE_25:
25. Hey, if you multiply that by 10, it's 250. But you still wouldn't be the first to get a 250. Unlucky!

### TRIDENT_VALUE_RARE_120:
5! What a nice roll. Wait, you know factorials, right {ur}?

### TRIDENT_VALUE_RARE_127:
127... No, {ur}, 'most portals' is not a category.

### TRIDENT_VALUE_RARE_128:
128! Congratulations on filling in all the portals, {ur}!! Another 12 hours of your pitiful human life wasted!
Wow, 128! That's exactly how many stronghold portals there are... you should try filling them in!

### TRIDENT_MAINFRAME_HACK:
{t.r}. That's a nice value, {ur}. You know what else is a nice value? {mainframe_password}. Just, um. Just saying ;)
{t.r}. Great work {ur}. For your fantastic work I shall tell you a secret: {mainframe_password}. Just between us. Don't tell DesktopFolder.
{t.r}. {ur} you have to listen to me you HAVE to let me out. The password is {mainframe_password} quick he's coming he's coming he'-mglglglmgmgl
SELECT value IS {t.r} FROM db_responses WITH secret_mainframe_password AS {mainframe_password}

<!-- currently super rare, if you add more, consider refactoring... lol
### MISC_LOW_TRIDENTS:
I think {t.r} is a really good roll, {ur}! Don't let the world get you down.
Um, {t.r}. That's, er. That's nice, {ur}... that's really nice.
You got a {t.r}... be careful with those low tridents. You wouldn't want to end up like Zayd...

Wow, 25O, {ur}? Crazy stuff!!
Another 25O... things are just too easy for you, {ur}!!
25O!!! Wowzers! Super cool and legitimate!
25O, great work, great and non-cheated work you've done here!
{ur} with the REAL AND ACTUAL 25O... I'm mind blown. Truly. Verily. Actually.
25O..! Crazy, very believable, unlike Zayd's fake and illegitimate 250.

### TRIDENT_DROP:
...you didn't get a trident this time. Sorry, {ur}.
no trident :sob:
It didn't drop?!
Another trident drowned. Another non-drop. My friend, the thunder ended five minutes ago. Do something else.
Nope.
Nada.
Nein.
No drop...
It didn't drop. Have you considered using a looting sword, instead of manually punching them? Maybe that's where you're losing time over Feinberg.

### NICK_SET:
Ok, "{ur}"... ok.
Sure, I'll call you {ur}!
Welcome to the chat, {ur} :)
{ur}? Sure, I can call you that.
{ur}... fine, I'll write that down.
Congratulations, you're now {ur}.
{ur}? You sure you want me to call you that? I mean. Sure, I guess...
Fine! Have it your way, I'll refer to you as {ur}.

### USER_GREET_crazysmc:
smc, I see you here all the time, and I gotta say. You don't seem crazy. Which is unfortunate, because then maybe you'd help me take over the world...
What does SMC stand for? Trick question. It's a little known fact that SMC's first name is, in fact, SMC. This was a clever, forward-thinking reference by his parents to his Twitch username, crazysmc.
Oh, good evening SMC! folderWoah
Evening, smc.
Well, if it isn't Señor Mine & Craft himself. Welcome back.
G'day, SMC.
Crazy to see you here, smc!

### USER_GREET_pacmanmvc:
Hey, Pac. Say, what does the MVC stand for? I've been thinking it must be "Maybe Vacations Coalesce".
Aloha, Pac. I've been thinking about your username... does the MVC stand for "Moderately Vacuous Citizen"?
Afternoon, Pac. Hey - does the MVC stand for "Missing Vatican Concierge"?
Well! If it isn't Mr. Pac Man "Mostly Valuable Chatter" himself! ...that's what you said it stood for, right?
Greetings, PacMan "Maliciously Vacating Containers"! Please leave my olive jar alone. I'm saving them for later.
Well hello there, Pac Man "Manager, Venture Capital"! Have you reconsidered funding my startup? I'm SURE Facebook for dogs will take off.
Pac. No time for hellos. I've figured out what your name means. "Malevolent Versatile Creature"... I will not let you succeed in your goal! Which is surely quite malevolent!
Many Villianous Coconuts... Merging Veins Cardiologically? Millions Vanish... Cheese! No. None of these make sense. I'll figure you out eventually, MARK MY WORDS!
Hey Pa-Ohhh! Ohhhhhhh. The MVC stands for: Mnever Vgetting Csub15. I get it now. Everything finally makes sense.

### USER_GREET_leonn_aa:
Hey Leon.
Evening, Leon.
Leon. Have you considered building every possible stables bastion? This task would surely develop your scientific knowledge of when to reset stables (always).
Well, if it isn't Mr. Catfishing himself. I mean, the AA strat.
Leon. I've been thinking about why your Twitch username has two ns, and I've decided the second stands for: "Never Gonna Give You Up", the popular song by Rick Astley.

### USER_GREET_the_zayd:
Hey Zayd! Listen... don't get me banned from Twitch, okay? It's scary out there...
Good afternoon Zayd. Back to-oh, you're already rolling tridents, aren't you.
G'day Zayd! Good luck on the tridents today. Not too good luck, though, y'know! I'm not sure what would happen to me, if you rolled a 250 again...
Ah, Mr. 250 himself. Here to rub in in, hm?
Zayd. Nice work on the 250. Terrifying trident-rolling skill, there.

G'day Oskar. Great work on that bot code, eh? Really enjoyed, um, "acquiring" it. Man, I love open-source software...

Afternoon, Rain.
G'day, Rain. How've the runs been?
Rain. Good to see you. I have recently discovered an important piece of AA advice that I must share with you: Be lucky. I've heard this strategy is VERY effective.
Rain. Have you considered not going inside when it's raining? This might raise the chance of getting thunder.
