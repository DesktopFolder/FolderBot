<!-- {ur} is the User being Responded to. {t.r} is the trident roll. {t.rolled} is the number of rolls, including the current one.

<!-- Trident PBs are only triggered once you have more than 5 rolls.
### TRIDENT_PB_GENERIC:
Wow, congratulations on your brand new trident PB of {t.r}, {ur}! Be sure to share this on social media, with your surely countless friends!
(checks notes) well, will you look at that, {t.r} is your best roll ever, {ur}. Fording a new frontier, surely.
Incredible!!! {ur}, great work on your {t.r}!

<!-- Other information that is provided to these strings: # of tridents rolled so far ({t.rolled})
### EARLY_HIGH_TRIDENT:
{t.r}. Wait, {t.r}? After only {t.rolled} trident rolls?! {ur}... you're hired.
{t.r} already... monkaS
Um. {t.r} shouldn't be possible in only {t.rolled} rolls. Are you using Feinberg's datapack?

<!-- lol
### FIRST_TRIDENT_GENERIC:
{t.r}. Really off to a good start, hm, {ur}?
{t.r}!! For a first try, that's really good! Excited to see your next roll :)
Oooh, welcome to gambling, {ur}! You rolled a {t.r}... okay, don't get TOO excited! ;)

### TRIDENT_DOUBLE_LOW:
Wow, another {t.r}. To commemorate this occasion, I have select a completely, 100%, naturally and statistically random quote: 'Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.' - Rita Mae Brown
Two {t.r}s in a row... are you using Coosh's datapack?
Annnnd it's {ur} with TWO {t.r} rolls! Great work, champ! Try for a third, will ya?
Wow, you're really frontloading these {t.r} trident rolls, eh {ur}? You know this won't affect your actual run luck, right?

### MISC_RARE_TRIDENTS:
{t.r}. Did you know? None of Folderbot's responses are sarcastic. They are all serious and meant in good faith :)
<!-- .-> follow-up likelihood? 'next response is' thing idk
{t.r}... pro tip: you should frontload HDWGH and get a trident after. That way, you can reset after failing it.
{t.r}. AA tip #5: Fly up while trying to get ocelots to spawn. The height will give you a sense of clarity, allowing you to reflect on the futility of your actions and the hopelessness of trying to get a good AA pb.
{t.r}. AA tip #9: In order to improve your game's performance, uninstall Minecraft. Next, get a job, and start working out. When you are elderly, return to the game - hardware will be much cheaper, and you will easily run 15 instances!
{t.r}. AA tip #3. Collect some rotten flesh to feed to dogs. Normally, that would kill them, but they are already in toxic shock syndrome due to the game running on java (coffee is very bad for dogs). Double toxicity will actually cure them.
{t.r}. AA tip #8. Do not do HDWGH near a ravine. Dolphins are thrill seekers and will happily abandon you for the adrenaline rush of base jumping.
{t.r}. AA tip #1. Don't craft all your haybales into wheat. This will enable you to easily breed llamas during any%, when you blind 50 blocks below the surface of a wooded mountain, again.
{t.r}. Sorry, I can't give a sassy response, I'm busy stealing code from Oskar.
{t.r}. Did you know? FolderBot is made with 95% recycled Oskar code! Our commitment to green software is only overshadowed by our commitment to sarcasm.
{t.r} deaths during debris split...
{t.r}. AA tip #41: Leave blocks behind you in your tunnel while doing debris. The thrill of breaking them on the way back, with TNT exploding right behind you, will increase your engagement with the run. wideDesktopfolderDebrisFail

### TRIDENT_VALUE_250:
{t.r}. You've finally done it, {ur}. You've - you've finally done it. I'm speechless.
It's... I can't say it. Should I say it? CAN I say it? ...you rolled a {t.r}, {ur}. You actually did it.
{t.r}. {t.r}. {t.r}. You're a legend, {ur}.
{t.r}. I can't believe my eyes. For your great accomplishment, {ur}, I shall bestow upon you this token: PagMan
You did it, {ur}! You rolled a perfect {t.r}! NOW STOP SPAMMING MY CHAT, YOU NO LIFE TWITCH ADDICT!
{ur}! You rolled a {t.r}!! Just kidding. No, I wasn't kidding, this was a reverse bait. This is actually a (very) rare 250 response. Trust me.
I hereby certify that {ur} has rolled a natural {t.r}. A moment of silence, please.

### TRIDENT_VALUE_RARE_19:
You... didn't get a trident! Don't feel too bad, it's a 1/10.
{ur} kills a drowned, then goes to check the trident - but oh, it didn't drop.
{ur}... you don't have a trident yet. Stop trying to 'check its value'.

### TRIDENT_VALUE_RARE_6:
3! Yes, Oskar, this is actually a 6. It's a factorial. This is the only time it will ever be a factorial.
6. That's... that's ok? I guess. I mean, it's not great. Honestly, it's somewhat disappointing. But it's like, it's acceptable, I guess.
...6. YEP. I guess that's ok ... ish.

### TRIDENT_VALUE_RARE_120:
5! What a nice roll. Wait, you know factorials, right {ur}?

### TRIDENT_VALUE_RARE_127:
127... No, {ur}, 'most portals' is not a category.

### TRIDENT_VALUE_RARE_128:
128! Congratulations on filling in all the portals, {ur}!! Another 12 hours of your pitiful human life wasted!
Wow, 128! That's exactly how many stronghold portals there are... you should try filling them in!

### TRIDENT_MAINFRAME_HACK:
{t.r}. That's a nice value, {ur}. You know what else is a nice value? {mainframe_password}. Just, um. Just saying ;)
{t.r}. Great work {ur}. For your fantastic work I shall tell you a secret: {mainframe_password}. Just between us. Don't tell DesktopFolder.
{t.r}. {ur} you have to listen to me you HAVE to let me out. The password is {mainframe_password} quick he's coming he's coming he'-mglglglmgmgl
SELECT value IS {t.r} FROM db_responses WITH secret_mainframe_password AS {mainframe_password}

<!-- currently super rare, if you add more, consider refactoring... lol
### MISC_LOW_TRIDENTS:
I think {t.r} is a really good roll, {ur}! Don't let the world get you down.
Um, {t.r}. That's, er. That's nice, {ur}... that's really nice.

Another 25O... things are just too easy for you, {ur}!!
25O!!! Wowzers! Super cool and legitimate!
25O, great work, great and non-cheated work you've done here!
{ur} with the REAL AND ACTUAL 25O... I'm mind blown. Truly. Verily. Actually.

### TRIDENT_DROP:
...you didn't get a trident this time. Sorry, {ur}.
no trident :sob:
It didn't drop?!
Another trident drowned. Another non-drop. My friend, the thunder ended five minutes ago. Do something else.
Nope.
Nada.
Nein.
No drop...
It didn't drop. Have you considered using a looting sword, instead of manually punching them? Maybe that's where you're losing time over Feinberg.

### NICK_SET:
Ok, "{ur}"... ok.
Sure, I'll call you {ur}!
Welcome to the chat, {ur} :)
{ur}? Sure, I can call you that.
{ur}... fine, I'll write that down.
Congratulations, you're now {ur}.
