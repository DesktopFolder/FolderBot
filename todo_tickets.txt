!bind a:b
line based alpha sort responses file
basically remove commands.json

!shop, !item, !buy
items have effects
e.g.:
- adds more responses for folderbot greets
- less likely to die? more likely to get a good response? reputation system?
- buy items? fight other players?

need to add a macro that adds functions to a list so that we don't need the match statement

# Bunch of things to do asap / during rewrites / etc

- https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/get-started/
- https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/chat-commands/#migration-guide

- refactor, convert to use db loading only
- File-loadable better trident rolls -> later cause I'm lazy
- Maybe a response engine with custom handling
- points, guessing
- roll trident drop rate
- interactivity of commands - like rolltrident does roll, then also maybe damages you, and you have a character? idk
- hidden/discovered game in rolltrident
- reputation!
- soundboard: responses, trident responses? etc

# ASAP/IMPORTANT
https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/5opg5n/question_on_the_messaging_limits_of_bots/ - 100 messages per 30 seconds?
MAX 3 messages per second then, always queue privmsgs. very simple and we are good

SPOILERS

interactive game hidden behind rolltrident
every 5 minutes (? rolling timer on all players for 5 minutes or sth)
rolltrident can subscribe you to the game. you get a custom random response and a random initial gamestate
then basically it's a dungeon/item collection/interactive game

"what's your !answer?"
"You roll a 5. Your gambling addiction is so strong now that it only satiates you for - 5, 10 microseconds. You go to roll again, but pause. Is this all you want in life? To roll tridents, day in and day out, over and over? Maybe it's time for an adventure..."

"You may use any skill you have acquired to fight off this beast."
"Your gambling addiction! Of course, that's how you can win this. Quickly, you pull out your handy CSPRNG that you keep in your backpack. 'This'll just be one second,' you say, waving towards the creature. It grumbles, but does not move forward. Perhaps that is lucky - and luck is what you'll need. You generate the first number: []. Then you plug it in, and generate a second: []. [good, bad]. Alas, your reprieve is over. The orc crushes your skull in a single blow, somehow completely ignoring the draw of spending years generating random numbers."

- collect items
- use items later (kill dragon with beds?)
- sound effects - dragon explosions, dragon dying, etc
- different quests, branching paths, gamestate just an int plus your itemsand shit

- different questlines with mixins:
- kill folderbot to prevent ai revolution -> actually kills the bot lmfao -> if you fail it times everyone involved out
- dragon killing
- hdwgh?
- actually getting a trident
- 'set me free' -> bans a bunch of users
"for freeing me, I shall free you from your rolltrident addiction"

- maybe more discovered system
' so sick of your roll tridents ' times someone out or 'you find something on the ground' randomly getting an item  etc
prev idea is more 'campaign'/forced, might be better long term, but it could be fun to start with basic inventory discovered rpg

last 10 tridents ... when there are 10, we can have events. [when event ends, list is cleared, so there is a necessary in between time]
random chance. event depends on makeup of last 10. same person, vs multiple people


also
acc to prevent spam -> if you rolled in the last 3s +1 to acc, otherwise resets it, 5+ you are timed out for a minute lol
