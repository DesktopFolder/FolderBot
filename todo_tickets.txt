# Bunch of things to do asap / during rewrites / etc

- File-loadable better trident rolls -> later cause I'm lazy
- Maybe a response engine with custom handling
- points, guessing
- roll trident drop rate
- interactivity of commands - like rolltrident does roll, then also maybe damages you, and you have a character? idk
- hidden/discovered game in rolltrident
